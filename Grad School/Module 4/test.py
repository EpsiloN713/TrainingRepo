But the debate was still not great. The night started with some audio problems during opening statements, particularly noticeable during Harris’s address. Two candidates were interrupted by shouting protesters, who ground the debate to a halt before CNN could restore order. It all just felt sloppy.

Beyond those issues, the problem was that the format was just terrible in a way that better moderation couldn’t save. The policy debates were too truncated to amount to much — health care, I’m looking at you — without being all that exciting.

And that might be showing up in the ratings, the final indignity for the network. The first night of the July debates got around half of the viewership of the June debates, hosted by MSNBC, and there’s little reason to think this night will be all that much better.

Loser: the DNC
Wednesday night’s debate was primarily aired and run by CNN, but the Democratic National Committee was a partner and is charged with managing the nomination contest’s debates overall. And let’s be blunt: This wasn’t a good debate, and it probably wasn’t good for the Democratic Party.

The first problem was simply that the debate was unsatisfying. And the reason for that is clear enough: The DNC decided back in February that, for its first two debates, there would be no “undercard” event in which the bottom-polling candidates would be separated from the top tier. Instead, it would hold two-night debates, and the 20 qualifying candidates would be assigned nights randomly.

The consequence was that in addition to ensuring poorly polling candidates would get a lot of airtime, it meant many of the top contenders wouldn’t even get to debate each other. Indeed, CNN deliberately ensured the top four candidates would be split, two on each night — and that choice made for a much less satisfying event overall.

On Wednesday night, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had a lengthy, desultory back-and-forth on health care that could have greatly benefited from the presence of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Warren and Sanders had to argue with various no-name moderates rather than the person they were really disagreeing with: Biden. (Warren has yet to share the debate stage with Biden or Harris, two of her most important rivals.)

The second problem for the DNC is how the questioning from its media partners has shaped up. As with nearly every debate night so far, many of the CNN moderators’ questions on Wednesday focused on controversial issues spotlighting conflict between the left of the party and the moderates: abolishing private health insurance, making unauthorized border crossing a civil rather than criminal offense, free college for unauthorized immigrants, and so on.

Now, that part isn’t the DNC’s fault; the party can’t control what CNN’s moderators choose to ask about, and in any case, the questions were about positions some of the candidates have taken. They were legitimate to ask about. But part of the DNC’s job is to help make sure the Democratic nominee wins the general election, and it seems like the debates so far may have made that more difficult.
